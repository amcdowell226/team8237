I'm thinking we need a random function for the random jingle
    (maybe keep it to five random audio notes ranging from 50-400 htz)
    (also not sure how we're gonna get multiple values from user)
        (maybe have them give one and increase/decrease the subsequent values by 50 or wateva)

we'll have to import this file to the gui one so maybe there should only be functions

not too sure how we're gonna get the audio to the user
    like i dunno if there's anything for it in pyside like there is for images
